# Session Update: Performance Optimization and Driver Mode Selection

## Additional Improvements Completed

### 1. Performance Optimization
**Speed Enhancement**: Reduced all `time.sleep()` delays by approximately 50%
- `time.sleep(1)` â†’ `time.sleep(0.5)` (50% faster)  
- `time.sleep(2)` â†’ `time.sleep(1)` (50% faster)

**Specific Optimizations**:
- Element registration waits: 1s â†’ 0.5s
- Cart operations: 1s â†’ 0.5s each
- Calendar navigation: 2s â†’ 1s  
- Error detection: 1s â†’ 0.5s
- Between slot selections: 1s â†’ 0.5s

**Performance Impact**:
- Total wait time reduced from ~8-10 seconds to ~4-5 seconds per session
- Approximately 50% faster booking operations while maintaining reliability
- Confirmed that `time.sleep()` accepts decimal numbers (0.3, 0.5, etc.)

### 2. Driver Mode Selection System
**Command-Line Integration**: Added argparse for easy mode switching
- Added `--headless` flag for command-line control
- Modified `automate_website_interaction()` to accept headless parameter
- Romanian feedback messages for mode indication

**Makefile Enhancement**: 
- `make run` - Default windowed mode (ðŸªŸ "Rulare Ã®n modul cu fereastrÄƒ")
- `make run-headless` - Headless mode (ðŸ”‡ "Rulare Ã®n modul headless (fÄƒrÄƒ fereastrÄƒ)")
- Updated help documentation with both options

**Technical Implementation**:
- Conditional driver initialization based on headless flag
- Preserved existing `create_browser_options()` function for headless configuration
- Clean separation between windowed and headless modes

### 3. Documentation Updates
**README.md Enhancement**: Added comprehensive usage guide
- Quick start section emphasizing `make run`
- Available commands listing
- Shell alias documentation (`neptun` command)
- Feature highlights with Romanian interface

**Benefits Achieved**:
- No manual code editing required for mode switching
- Faster execution in headless mode (no GUI rendering overhead)
- Easy debugging with windowed mode when needed
- Maintained Romanian localization throughout

## Technical Patterns Applied

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- Conservative reduction approach (50% faster while maintaining reliability)
- Focused on web automation timing constraints
- Preserved critical waits for DOM updates and AJAX requests

### Command-Line Architecture
- Clean argparse integration with descriptive help text
- Mode selection via boolean flag with clear default behavior
- Makefile abstraction for user-friendly command interface

### User Experience Focus
- Romanian feedback for mode selection
- Consistent command patterns (`make run` vs `make run-headless`)
- Comprehensive documentation for easy adoption
